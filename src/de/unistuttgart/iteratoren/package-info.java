/**
Minimal Iterator Demo
----------------------

This tries to keep it really simple!

- SimpleList: is the actual list class
- SimpleNode: stores a value and the next node
- SimpleIterator: only the bare minimum is there

- ReverseIterator: shows how you can implement different iterators for one collection.

- Main: run the program
