	 * A* vs Dijkstra
	 * 
	 * A* is like Dijkstra but is uses a heuristic to estimate the future way.
	 * 
	 * The "expand" step of A* is pretty much the same as the update of the
	 * priority queue Q in the Dijkstra algorithm. Here we don't simply update
	 * the distance according the next best node, but also use a heuristic to
	 * estimate the future way. Because we do so, we have to update these
	 * estimates, which makes a A* a bit more complicated than Dijkstra.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Important Functions:
	 * 
	 * g(u) - costs from start to u: nodeFunctions.getG(u);
	 * 
	 * h(u) - heuristic for the costs from u to the goal: nodeFunctions.getH(u);
	 * 
	 * f(u) - costs from start to goal over u: g(u) + h(u):
	 * nodeFunctions.getF(u);
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Important data structures:
	 * 
	 * - open - list of nodes for which a (not necessary optimal) way exists.
	 * the node with the smallest f value is the potential best node.
	 * 
	 * - closed - nodes with known shortest way
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The implementation here follows the pseudo code in the script really
	 * closely.
